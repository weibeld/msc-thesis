libfa:
1.0.0 - 2012-12-21
  - General changes/additions
    * fix missing requirement on libxml2 in pkg-config
    * do not replace pathin with '/*' unless the length is 0

    * remove Linux-isms so tests can run on Solaris
    * re-open rl_outstream/stdout only when stdout isn't a tty
      (fixes -e -i); use /dev/tty instead of /dev/stdout when re-opening
      to prevent permission errors, bug #241
    * take root into account for excludes, bug #252
    * fix different errors for parse and put failure
    * fix various memory leaks
    * add leak test
    * allocate exception instead of static const value
    * improve aug_srun quoting to permit concatenation and better detect
      bad quoting
    * rename echo to echo_commands to fix differing types reported
      with Solaris linker (Tim Mooney), bug #262
    * fix excl filters that only specify a filename or wildcard
    * make sure reloading discards changes after save with mode 'newfile'
    * remove loop that added a second iteration around children of /files,

      /files/boot, bug #264
    * support \t and \n in aug_srun tokens, bug #265
    * compile_exp: don't return an uninitialized pointer upon failure
      (Jim Meyering)
    * include 'extern "C"' wrapper for C++, bug #272 (Igor Pashev)

      they are sent to sed (Micah Anderson)
    * add new print_tree primitive
    * fix bad memory access in regexp.c

      RedHat bug #772257, CVE-2012-0786
    * prevent cross-mountpoint attacks via .augsave during saving,
      RedHat bug #772261, CVE-2012-0787
    * add bundled (gnulib) provides in augeas.spec.in, RedHat bug #821745

    * src/transform.c (xread_file): catch failed fopen, e.g. EACCES

    * make get_square case insensitive on the ending key
    * escape double quotes when dumping regexp
    * use constants for "lens", "incl" and "excl"
    * src/transform.c (filter_generate): remove duplicate variable assignment
    * src/jmt.c (parse_add_item): ensure return is defined on goto error
    * src/transform.c (transform_save): chmod after creating new files to
      permissions implied by the umask
    * ignore eclipse settings directory
    * fix memory leak in dbg_visit
    * build AST while visiting the parse v2
    * rewrite square lens to be more generic, allowing e.g. square quoting
    * tests/modules/fail_shadow_union.aug: fix unintended test failure
    * src/syntax.c (compile_test): print which test failed when missing
      exception
    * libfa (fa_enumerate): new function
    * use precise ctype of a square lens if it is indeed regula
    * square: properly handle first lens matching empty string
    * square lens: correctly process skeletons during put
    * src/pathx.c: disallow ',' in names in path expressions
    * src/pathx.c: match functions by name and arity
    * src/pathx.c: pass the number of actual arguments to the func
      implementation
    * correctly parse escaped string literals in vim syntax file (Domen Ko¿ar)

0.10.0 - 2011-12-02
  - fix bug in libfa that would incorrectly calculate the difference of a
    case sensistive and case insensitive regexp (/[a-zA-Z]+/ - /word/i
    would match 'worD')

0.7.1 - 2010-04-21
  - libfa: handle '(a|)' and 'r{min,}' properly

0.7.0 - 2010-01-14
  - New public functions fa_nocase, fa_is_nocase, and fa_expand_nocase in
    libfa

0.5.3 - 2009-09-14
  - libfa: properly support regexps with embedded NUL's

0.5.2 - 2009-07-13
  - reduce symbols exported from libfa with linker script

0.5.0 - 2009-03-27
  - Clean up interface for libfa; the interface is now considered stable
  - Several performance improvements in libfa

0.3.0 - 2008-08-07
  - Avoid picking special characters, in particular '\0', in examples (libfa)

0.1.1 - 2008-05-16
  - Many many bugfixes:
    * plugged all known memory leaks
    * fixed typecheck for lens union (l1 | l2) which was plain wrong
    * reduce overall memory usage by releasing unused compiled regexps
    * further performance improvements in libfa
    * check that values match the regexps in STORE when saving
  - libfa can now convert an automaton back to a regular expression
    (FA_AS_REGEXP)

0.0.7 - 2008-03-14
  - Greatly improved libfa performance to make typechecking reasonably
    fast. Typechecking cmfm.aug went from more than two hours to under two
    seconds

0.0.5 - 2008-03-05
  - Added libfa, finite automata library, though it's not yet used by
    Augeas
