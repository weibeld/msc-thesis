Building

  These instructions apply to building a released tarball. If you want to
  build from a git checkout, see the file HACKING.

  See the generic instructions in INSTALL. Generally,
    ./configure
    make && make install
  should be all that is needed.

  You need to have libxml2-devel installed.
