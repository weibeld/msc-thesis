/*
 * This is the hash table control structure. It keeps track of information
 * about a hash table, as well as the hash table itself.
 * Notes:
 * 1.  Pointer to the hash table proper. The table is an array of pointers to
 *     hash nodes (of type hnode_t). If the table is empty, every element of
 *     this table is a null pointer. A non-null entry points to the first
 *     element of a chain of nodes.
 * 2.  This member keeps track of the size of the hash table---that is, the
 *     number of chain pointers.
 * 3.  The count member maintains the number of elements that are presently
 *     in the hash table.
 * 4.  The maximum count is the greatest number of nodes that can populate this
 *     table. If the table contains this many nodes, no more can be inserted,
 *     and the hash_isfull() function returns true.
 * 5.  The high mark is a population threshold, measured as a number of nodes,
 *     which, if exceeded, will trigger a table expansion. Only dynamic hash
 *     tables are subject to this expansion.
 * 6.  The low mark is a minimum population threshold, measured as a number of
 *     nodes. If the table population drops below this value, a table shrinkage
 *     will occur. Only dynamic tables are subject to this reduction.  No table
 *     will shrink beneath a certain absolute minimum number of nodes.
 * 7.  This is the a pointer to the hash table's comparison function. The
 *     function is set once at initialization or creation time.
 * 8.  Pointer to the table's hashing function, set once at creation or
 *     initialization time.
 * 9.  The current hash table mask. If the size of the hash table is 2^N,
 *     this value has its low N bits set to 1, and the others clear. It is used
 *     to select bits from the result of the hashing function to compute an
 *     index into the table.
