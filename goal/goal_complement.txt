kurshan		Kurshan's
Only for deterministic Büchi automata. Complementation of deterministic Büchi automata.

classic		Classic
Only for finite-word automata. Determinization by subset-construction, then complementation by
switching accepting and non-accepting states.

deterministic
Only on command line. Probably for testing if a Büchi automaton is deterministic. If run on a non-determinstic
Büchi automaton or a non-Büchi automaton outputs: ERROR: Unknown result in complementing in.gff. If run on a
deterministic Büchi automaton, outputs the same automaton.
