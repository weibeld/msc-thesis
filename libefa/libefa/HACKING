This file explains some details about developing the libefa C library.

Building from git
-----------------

  Besides the usual build tools (gcc, autoconf, automake etc.) you need the
  following tools and libraries to build libefa:

    * libxml2-devel

  At its simplest, you build libefa from git by running the following
  commands in the toplevel directory of your libefa checkout:

    autoreconf
    ./configure
    make
    make install

  It is recommended though to turn on a few development features when
  building; in particular, stricter compiler warnings and some debug
  logging. You can pass these options to configure.
