Büchi invented Büchi automata to proof that satisfiability for S1S is decidable: To check whether a given S1S formulaφ=φ(V0,...,Vm−1)is satisfiable one simply constructs the Büchi automaton which is guaranteed to exist by Büchi’s Theorem and checks this automaton for non-emptiness.

Büchi Automata
--------------
Nondeterministic (main interest)
Deterministic Büchi automata are less expressive than nondeterministic ones

Muller Automata
---------------
Deterministic (main interest)
Source: Safra, 1988 (2), p. 2

Acceptance Conditions of Omega-Automata
---------------------------------------
- Büchi: at least one accepting state in the set of infinitely visited states
- Muller: whole set of infinitely visited states must be one of the designated sets
- Rabin: for at least one pair of sets of states, on state in the first set is visited infinitely, and none in the second set is visited infinitely often
- Streett: for all sets of pairs, if at least one state of the first set is visited infinitely often, then at least one state of the second set must be visited infinitely often
Source: Safra, 1988 (2), p. 4

McNaughton's Theorem
--------------------
Languages accepted by det. Muller == Languages accepted by nondet. Büchi automata
== regular w-languages
--> NBW can be converted to DMW
Source: Safra, 1988 (2), p. 2
McNaughton, R.: Testing and generating infinite sequences by a finite automaton, 1966

w-Regular Languages
-------------------
All the languages accepted by:
Nondeterministic.
- Büchi automata
Deterministic and nondeterministic:
- Muller automata
- Rabin automata
- Streett automata
- Parity automata
Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_automaton
The class of w-languages recognised by deterministic Büchi automata is weaker, i.e. there are languages that can be recognised by a nondeterministic Büchi automaton, but not by a deterministic one.

Lower bound of determinization of NBW

2^O(n log n) = (0.36n)^n = n!

Lower bound of complementation of NBW

Representations of runs (sequence of states) of an automaton on a word
-------------
- Run tree
- Split tree
	- First step for reduced split trees, originate also from Muller, Schupp
	- Subset construction where acc and non-acc states are not mixed, as in Nitsche, 2006 (if each node is taken as a separate state)
- Reduced split tree
    - Originate from Muller-Schupp trees, Muller, Schupp, 1995

Büchi's Theorem
---------------
For every S1S formula there exists a Büchi automaton, and for every Büchi automaton there exists a S1S formula
--> Vardi, Wilke, 2007, p. 8

S1S

Monadic second-order logic with one successor
--> Vadi, Wilke, p. 4

- Non-deterministic finite state automata and the subset-construction have been introducec by Rabin and Scott, 1959

- The McNaughton's Theorem says that a NBW can be converted into a deterministic Muller automaton (DMW), see Althoff, 2006

- A DRW is a special case of a DMW (Althoff, 2006)

- Rabin and Streett automata are dual, i.e. if a given automaton A is interpreted as a Rabin automaton Ar and as a Streett automaton As, then L(Ar) = complement(L(As)). See Klein, Msc Thesis, 2005, Sec. 2.6.1

- The Safra construction (Safra, 1988) is a determinisation procedure for NBW. It converts an NBW to a DRW

- Safra construction is described in:
	- Roggenbach, 2002
	- Klein, 2006
	- Klein, 2005, MSc thesis
	- Althoff, 2006
	
- In 1988, Michel gave a lower bound of n! =~ (n/e)^n =~ (0.36n)^n or in big-O 2^O(n log n) for complementing NBW
	- Michel, Complementation is more difficult with automata on infinite words, 1988. NOT ACCESSIBLE
	- Löding, Optimal bounds for the transformation of omega-automata, 1999
	
- In 2006, Yan gave a lower bound of (0.76n)^n for complementing NBW
	- Yan, Lower Bounds for Complementation of ω-Automata Via the Full Automata Technique, 2006

- A proof that DBW are less expressive than NBW is given in Roggenbach, 2002

- DBW are not closed under complementation, proof in Thomas, 1999, p. 14 bottom
