- Non-deterministic finite state automata and the subset-construction have been introducec by Rabin and Scott, 1959

- The McNaughton's Theorem says that a NBW can be converted into a deterministic Muller automaton (DMW), see Althoff, 2006

- A DRW is a special case of a DMW (Althoff, 2006)

- Rabin and Streett automata are dual, i.e. if a given automaton A is interpreted as a Rabin automaton Ar and as a Streett automaton As, then L(Ar) = complement(L(As)). See Klein, Msc Thesis, 2005, Sec. 2.6.1

- The Safra construction (Safra, 1988) is a determinisation procedure for NBW. It converts an NBW to a DRW

- Safra construction is described in:
	- Roggenbach, 2002
	- Klein, 2006
	- Klein, 2005, MSc thesis
	- Althoff, 2006
	
- In 1988, Michel gave a lower bound of n! =~ (n/e)^n =~ (0.36n)^n or in big-O 2^O(n log n) for complementing NBW
	- Michel, Complementation is more difficult with automata on infinite words, 1988. NOT ACCESSIBLE
	- Löding, Optimal bounds for the transformation of omega-automata, 1999
	
- In 2006, Yan gave a lower bound of (0.76n)^n for complementing NBW
	- Yan, Lower Bounds for Complementation of ω-Automata Via the Full Automata Technique, 2006

- A proof that DBW are less expressive than NBW is given in Roggenbach, 2002

- DBW are not closed under complementation, proof in Thomas, 1999, p. 14 bottom
