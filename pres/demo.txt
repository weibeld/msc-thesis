- Command line prepared by sourcing:
    ```
    cd /Applications/GOAL.app/Contents/Resources/Java
    history -s ./gc complement -m fribourg -r2c -m1 -m2 '~/Desktop/in.gff'
    history -s ./gc complement -m piterman '~/Desktop/in.gff'
    ```


Demonstration of GOAL
---------------------

- Start GOAL
- Generate random automaton ($dt=2.4$, $da=0.4$)
- Complement it
- Open property window by double-clicking on window
- Save input automaton to file `~/Desktop/in.gff`
- In command line `cat ~/Desktop/in.gff`
- Complement automaton on command line 
    - `./gc complement -m piterman ~/Desktop/in.gff` (one step back in history)
    - `./gc complement -m piterman ~/Desktop/in.gff >~/Desktop/out_piterman.gff`
- Switch to GUI and drag `~/Desktop/out_piterman.gff` into it
- Make an equivalence test between the two output automata (Tab 1 and Tab 2)
- Close GOAL


Demonstration of the plugin
---------------------------

- Switch to Preview and click on link on previous slide
- Unzip `~/Desktop/ch.unifr.goal.complement` by double-clicking it
- Show content of folder `ch.unifr.goal.complement`
- Open finder in `/Applications`
- Right-click `GOAL.app` > Show package contents, go to Contents > Resources > Java
- Move `ch.unifr.goal.complement` from Desktop to `plugins`
- Close Finder
- Open GOAL via icon in dock
- Drag `~/Desktop/in.gff` into it
- Automaton > Complement > Fribourg construction
- Select R2C, M1, and M2 options
- Switch to command line
    - `./gc help complement` (type)
    - `./gc complement -m fribourg -r2c -m1 -m2 ~/Desktop/in.gff` (in history)
- Switch to GUI
- Possible to test equivalence between complements of Fribourg and Piterman, but takes too long
- Open Tab 0 (`in.gff`)
- Automaton > Complement (Step by Step) > Fribourg construction
    - Some steps manual (`>|`) then automatic (`>>`) (upper part)
    - Some steps manual (`>|`) then automatic (`>>`), and switch to another tab for some seconds
