Below we present statistics about the measured execution times of the complementation tasks on the \goal{} test set. Note that the execution times for the Michel test set are presented in Chapter~\ref{chap_results}.

The reported values are in CPU time seconds. All the execution time measurements in this thesis have been done by the \texttt{time} reserved word of Bash.

The second-last column of each table contains the total of the execution times of all the effective samples in the corresponding test. The last column converts this total number of seconds to hours.

Note that in general measurements of execution times are dependent on the implementation, execution environment, and on other factors, such as the way the time measurement is done by the operating system, or the current load of the processor. This is why we use the execution times only as an auxiliary performance measure.
