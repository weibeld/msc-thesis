Abstract = {The complementation problem for nondeterministic word automata has numerous applications in formal verification. In particular, the language-containment problem, to which many verification problems is reduced, involves complementation. For automata on finite words, which correspond to safety properties, complementation involves determinization. The 2n blow-up that is caused by the subset construction is justified by a tight lower bound. For Büchi automata on infinite words, which are required for the modeling of liveness properties, optimal complementation constructions are quite complicated, as the subset construction is not sufficient. From a theoretical point of view, the problem is considered solved since 1988, when Safra came up with a determinization construction for Büchi automata, leading to a 2O(n log n) complementation construction, and Michel came up with a matching lower bound. A careful analysis, however, of the exact blow-up in Safra's and Michel's bounds reveals an expo},
