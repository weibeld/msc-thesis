Introduction

Background
- Context of B端chi complementation: system verification
- B端chi complementation: map of the territory to cover
    - Definition of B端chi automata
    - Notation
- Review of B端chi complementation algorithms
    - Maybe use classification in four approaches as in Tsai, 2010
    - Put emphasis on the ones that will later be used in the experiments, but dont' mention this
- Fribourg construction
    - Put in relation with above framework
    - What about epsilon-transitions?
- Experimental evaluations of algorithms
  - Tsai, results
  - Christian

Experimental investigation
- "THIS is what I'm doing and THIS is how I am going to investigate it"
    - Aim: investigate performance of Fribourg construction experimentally
    - Means: implement it, use GOAL, where other algorithms are implemented, perform experiments
- GOAL
- Compare algorithm options internally
- Compare with other algorithms
    - Justifiy: only piterman, rank, and slice
- Justifiy measures
    - Measure only number of generated states (not transitions, acc states, densities, etc.), use of the -r option, take into account time or not?
- Experiment description
  - What compare to what
  - Test data
  - Justify

Results

Discussion
- All things that I know now that I didn't know at the beginning
- Limitations of own work
    - Test data, many universal automata, fixed size, fixed alphabet size (representativeness of test set), time, memory, some algorithms cannot even be compared, GOAL implementation (dependable?),
    - How I would have done it in an idea research world
