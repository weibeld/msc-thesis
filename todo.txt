- Complementation algorithm option passing as variables: does it work in the new version of GOAL? -> No, it's the same
- Update to new version of GOAL on Mac -> Done
- Report bug in new GOAL version (2014-08-08): the Ctr-C (or Cmd-C on Mac) shortcut for complementation does not work -> Done
- Asking for ControllableTab output panel: rank and slice do it right. With all the other algorithms, the panel grows as well. -> Done
- Asking for GOAL batch complementation algorithm options -> Done
- Script for transferring files and folders between local machine and cluster -> Done
- RSA authentication on cluster (for login without entering password) -> Done
- Cluster submit options and folder structure -> Done
- Rename test automata files -> Done
- Script for complementing the 11'000 test automata and reporting generated number of states, used real time, and used CPU time -> Done
- R script for evaluating the data in the result file of the above script

- submit.sh: add option for parallel environment SMP (request 2 or 3 slots for GOAL complementation)
- submit.sh: add scratch as default (or option)
- submit.sh: save issued qsub command in file
- complement.sh: use default time command (not GNU time) because it has a higher precision (1/1000 sec.) and GNU time which has only 1/100 sec. precision seems to just truncate the least significant digit (instead of rounding)
- complement.sh: use local scratch (for automata and tmp file)
- complement.sh: set values for t_out and m_out to Y and N
- complement.sh: add columns for transition density and acceptance density
- complement.sh: show user_cpu and sys_cpu in two separate columns
- R package with functions for reading and analysing result data
